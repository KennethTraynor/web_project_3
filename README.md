# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

This project focused on making a website that has a responsive layout. This means making the website adjust to different screen resolutions to allow different devices to display the page in a more pleasing form.


## Functionality

* The CSS code will adjust the size of elements to better fit the resolution it is being displayed on

* The elements that make up the website use less fixed values to allow the website to scale easier

## Technologies & Techniques

**Technologies:**

* Visual Studio Code: Developing the website's code

* Figma: Layout reference for the webpage

* Git: updating and tracking versions of the code

* Github: Holding the versions and hosting the webpage with Github Pages

**Techniques:**

* The @media query to tell the CSS which elements should change at certain resolutions

* Grid layout for it's scalability and ease of use for creating grids with little amount of code

* Utilized percentages, viewport size, and the calc() function to control the size of elements instead of fixed values
